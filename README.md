### 🏙️ Mission Statement

*To saving users time, energy and gas.*

The Out App is designed to allow users to stay in-the-know with real-time information about locations nearby and increase service amongst community members. People hate to put time, energy and gas into travelling just to be disappointed - our users don’t have this worry.

### 🚀 Problem Statement

Traveling to locations can be time-consuming and expensive, especially during peak hours or when there are traffic jams. This can be frustrating for users, and it can also lead to increased fuel consumption and pollution.

Target users:
* People who wanna know before they go!
* Community members being serviced locally.
* People who frequently travel to entertainment locations, such as restaurants, concerts, and sporting events.

### 📚 Tech Stack: 

I intend on using React to build out the front end, Node.js and Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL as my database. I'll also utilize the Material UI library to design the front end and the Google Maps API to implement the map and searching features.
